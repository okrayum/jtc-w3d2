# W3D2-Exercise - FS - S24 - Data Types and Structures

### Objective

Parse and process data related to data types and structures in programming.

### Estimated Time to Complete

60 minutes

### Learning Objectives

- Practice parsing and processing nested data structures.

### Assignment Overview:

The assignment aims to reinforce the concepts covered in the session on data types and structures. You will be tasked with practical exercises and a mini-project to apply your understanding of data types in programming.

### Assignment Tasks:

1. Programming Exercises:
   - Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
   - Implement a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter their name and age, stores this information in an object, and then prints out the object's properties.

### Getting Started

1. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!).
2. Clone the repository to your computer.
3. Follow the instructions provided.

NOTE: Ensure that you understand the principles of data types and structures as you'll be working with them extensively.

### Test Cases

- Python task
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: Sum of even numbers: 12

- JS Task
When you run this script in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a web browser's developer console), it will prompt you to enter your name and age. For example, if you enter "John" for the name and "30" for the age, the output will be:

Output: 
User Name: John
User Age: 30

### Unit Testing

- In the test file provided, you will find unittests for the methods you need to implement. Make sure your methods pass these tests.

- Python Files
From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest tests.test_sum_even_numbers` to see if your code works as expected.

- JS Files
`npm install --save-dev jest`
From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of ``

- REMEMBER: Comment out or delete the calls to your methods; the tests will not run with them!

### Git Local

Perform commands for `git add`, `git status`, `git commit`, `git push`.

### Git Remote

1. Access your GitHub Repository: Go to the GitHub website and log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the repository for this exercise.
3. Watch for the Red X (or yellow dot as the test runs) to change to the green check mark. The green check mark on a GitHub repository indicates that the commit or pull request has been tested and meets the defined criteria for correctness.
4. If there's a red "X" instead, it means the tests have failed. You'll need to investigate and fix the issues in your code, then perform the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` steps again.

### Submit URL & Screenshot in Canvas

1. Navigate to the exercise in Canvas
   - Comment Section: Submit a screenshot of your terminal showing the results of your unit tests.
   - URL submission Box: GitHub remote repository exercise URL

### Grade in Canvas

The status in Canvas does not change to Complete until an Instructor has reviewed your assignment. This process is similar to the Code review process in a real work scenario. A code review by an instructor or a senior developer after unit tests pass is an important step in the software development process. It helps ensure that the code not only functions correctly but also adheres to best practices, coding standards, and maintainability guidelines.

Submit and then you are set!
